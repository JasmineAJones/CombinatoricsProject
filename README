This program is designed to display how Combinatorial Explosion works in respect to a resturant menu.

Note: The distribution of items in attributes produces a different graph 
ie. Having 12 items in entrees would produce a different graph than having 12 items distributed evenly

Requirements to run code:
py -m pip install pyqt5
py -m pip install matplotlib
